# AES-encryption-in-Verilog
AES encryption and decryption algorithms implemented in Verilog programming language.

The results of encryption and decryption processes are retrieved from Modelsim. The encyption has been implemented correctly; however, the decryption implementation has some unidentified problems. 

Please, feel free to change the input key to get another ciphered outputs. If you are not completely familiar with AES encryption, you can watch the detailed example attached to the repository.
